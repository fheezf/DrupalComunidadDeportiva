# DrupalComunidadDeportiva

A sports diary made in Drupal. It only works on Football Sport, but it can be easily upgradeable.

# Requisites.

You need to have PHP, MySql and Drupal. I recommend to install XAMPP.

The File comunidaddeportiva.sql has the entire database if you want to import it, but you will need to augment the execution max time limit
in config.default.php.
